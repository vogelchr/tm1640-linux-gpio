A quick program to talk to a TM1640 16x7-segment LED connected to two Linux GPIOs, the
"reference board" is a Deal Extreme (JY-MCU 16X).

Be careful, there are pullups to +5V on the board when you connect them
to 3v3 GPIOs!

Defaults are set for the GPIOs on a Toradex T20 board on a Iris carrier.

  > #define DEFAULT_DIN     29 /* gpio 29 == SODI-98, Iris X16-13 */ 
  > #define DEFAULT_SCLK    89 /* gpio 89 == SOD-103, Iris X16-15 */

You can change those pin mappings with the commandline options.
